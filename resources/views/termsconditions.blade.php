<br>

<p>The customer is responsible for complying with the instructions of the airline and/or tour operator, in particular with respect to flight check-in times. In particular, the customer acknowledges and agrees that:</p>
<ul class="listdot">
<li>Airlines reserve the right to cancel or change schedules without notice. Schedules shown are based on expected flying times as indicated by the airlines. Because weather and other factors may affect operating conditions, departures and arrivals cannot be guaranteed nor are the responsibility of Wox Travel & Tour W.L.L.</li>
<li>Wox Travel & Tour W.L.L. has no control over the allocation of seats on any air transport, even if pre-booked with the airline, and does not guarantee that specific seats will be available on departure.</li>
<li>Wox Travel & Tour W.L.L. has no control over any indications of the hours spent flying which are provided by the supplier of the relevant air transport and are given for guidance only and are subject to alteration and confirmation.</li>
<li>It is the customer’s responsibility to confirm his / her return flight in accordance with the requirements of the supplier of the relevant air transport.</li>
<li>If the Customer books a return journey and does not use the outward flight, the airline may cancel the return flight without refund. This also applies if the return flight is not taken and insofar as the travel is not taken at all. The Customer must use flight coupons in sequence.</li>
<li>In the case of special or charter flights, the name of the airline, the flight schedule, the aircraft type, the itinerary and possible intermediate stops are only given as an indication of the outward and return flights in the trip. In accordance with a supplier’s rules and restrictions, these flights, aircraft types and flight numbers are subject to change, even after confirmation.</li>
<li>Additional charges may be imposed by airlines for meals, luggage, seat selection, etc. Wox Travel & Tour W.L.L. is not responsible for such charges and may be amended by airlines at any time.</li>
<li>The customer must comply with all air transport supplier’s rules and restrictions on the carriage of pregnant women.</li>
<li>Airlines reserve the right to assess additional charges that could include an additional ticket purchase for passengers who may be too large to comfortably sit in one seat.</li>
<li>The customer must comply with the air transport supplier’s rules and restrictions on the carriage of children and in particular that children older than 2 years on the return date must have a return ticket at a child fare for both the outbound and inbound flights. Customers who do not comply will not be eligible for a refund of any seat charges incurred during travel. Children under 2 years will not be allocated their own seat in the aircraft, unless a child fare has been booked for them. Unaccompanied children under 14 will only be carried in accordance with the air transport Supplier’s Rules and Restrictions.</li>
<li>In case of reissuance, the incurring difference in fare along with airline penalty charges and an additional service fee would be applicable in this case.

Please contact the airline for more information. </li>

<br>

<h2>TRAVEL INSURANCE</h2>
<p>The prices on the website do not include travel insurance. The Customer is therefore advised to take out insurance that covers the consequences of certain cases of cancellation and that also provides cover for certain special risks such as the cost of repatriation in the event of an accident or illness. It is the Customer’s responsibility to ensure any insurance policy taken out is adequate to cover their requirements.</p>
<p>The risks covered by these policies, as well as the cost and the amount of cover, are shown on the website only for the purpose of illustration. In the event that a policy is bought, the insurer will send the policy to the Customer. Claims must be submitted directly to the insurance company in accordance with the terms and conditions of the policy. Customers are fully responsible for arranging their own travel insurance. Should the insurers dispute their liability for any reason, the customer will have recourse against the insurers only.</p>
<br>

<h2>DELAYS</h2>
<p>If an airline cancels or delays a flight, is unable to provide previously confirmed space, fails to stop at a Customer’s stop-over or destination point, or causes a Customer to miss a connecting flight on which a Customer holds a reservation, the Customer may be entitled to certain remedies from the airline. Wox Travel & Tour will not be liable for any delays prior to departure or during travel to any hotels / resorts brought about by airline technical difficulties, strikes, weather conditions or any other circumstances out of our control. Any expenses relating to these unscheduled extensions will be for the customer’s own account.</p>
<br>

<h2>TRAVEL DOCUMENTS</h2>
<p>It is the passengers’ responsibility to ensure their travel documents, necessary visas, vaccinations, preventative medicines and other medical certificates that may be needed by the various Government authorities of the countries to be visited are in order.</p>
<p>As a guide, you must have an international Passport or other recognized travel documents which should be valid for at least six (6) months from the date of the departure from the last destination of your itinerary.  The company shall assist you to obtain the necessary visas whenever possible.  Service charges and visa fees levied shall be borne by the passengers.  The visa approval is subject and at the sole discretion of the respective country’s Immigration Department / Home Office and Wox Travel & Tour is not liable for the outcome of the application.</p>
<p>If for any reason your application for the visa or necessary exit permit is rejected, the relevant cancellation charges as per cancellation charges table above shall apply.</p>
<p>The company cannot be held responsible or liable for any expenses, reimbursement, or refund of tour prices if any passenger is refused entry by a country on the tour for whatsoever reasons, including lack of necessary visa. Information about these matters is given in good faith by Wox Travel & Tour but without liability. It is important that you check all details provided on your travel documentation are correct upon receipt. If there are any inaccuracies, please contact the Wox Travel & Tour immediately. All customers will be personally responsible for ensuring they are in possession of the correct and necessary documentation prior to departure. It is the customer’s responsibility to obtain correct, current and valid passports and re-entry permits where required. Wox Travel & Tour will not be liable for any consequence of any nature arising from the customer failing to ensure he or she has complied with such requirements. </p>
<p>For information on visa requirements, Customers are advised to contact the embassy of the country they propose to visit.</p>
<p>Please note: It can often take some time to obtain a visa, so customers are advised to apply in advance. Requirements may change and you should check for up-to-date information before booking and departure. We accept no liability if you are refused entry onto a flight or into any country due to your failure to carry the correct and adequate passport, visa, or other travel documents required by any airline, authority, or country, including countries you may just be transiting through. This includes all stops made by the aircraft, even if you do not leave the aircraft or airport.</p>
<p>Although most travel, including travel to international destinations, is completed without incident, travel to certain destinations may involve greater risk than others. Wox Travel & Tour W.L.L. urges passengers to review any travel prohibitions, warnings, announcements and advisories issued by the concerned authorities prior to booking travel to international destinations.</p>
<br>

<h2>HEALTH REGULATIONS</h2>
<p>All customers are expected to satisfy themselves prior to booking that they are fit and able to complete the itinerary of their chosen tour as described in the brochure. Any customers with pre-existing medical conditions or illness must declare the true nature of such conditions at the time of booking and make necessary arrangements for the provision of any medication or other treatment which may be required during the tour. Such a customer is required to provide a medical statement from a General Practitioner to confirm they are fit to travel. Failure to make such disclosure will constitute a breach of these booking conditions and relieve Wox Travel & Tour from any obligations and liability.</p>
<p>Health: Recommended inoculations for travel may change and you should consult your doctor for current recommendations before you depart. It is your responsibility to ensure that you meet all health entry requirements, obtain the recommended inoculations, take all recommended medication, and follow all medical advice in relation to your trip. For medical advice regarding your journey, please contact your doctor.</p>
<p><b>Disinfection:</b> Countries reserve the right to disinfect aircraft if there is a perceived threat to public health, agriculture or the environment. The World Health Organization and the International Civil Aviation Organization have approved the following disinsection procedures: spray the aircraft cabin with an aerosolized insecticide while passengers are on board or treat the aircraft’s interior surfaces with a residual insecticide while passengers are not on board.</p>
<br>

<h2>CUSTOMER EXCLUSION & LOCAL LAW</h2>
<p>Customers agree to accept the authority and decisions of Wox Travel & Tour and its supplier's employees and representatives whilst on tour. If in the opinion of such persons, the health or conduct of a customer before or after the departure appears likely to endanger the safe, comfortable or happy progress of the tour, the customer may be excluded from all or part of the tour without prior notice or any liability on the part of Wox Travel & Tour. In case of a customer’s ill heath, Wox Travel & Tour may make such arrangements as it sees fit and will recover the costs thereof from the customer. Customers agree to comply with the laws and regulations of the countries they travel. Wox Travel & Tour shall not be liable for any customers who commit illegal or unlawful acts whilst on tour.</p>
